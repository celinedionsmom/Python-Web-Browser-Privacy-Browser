Privacy Web Browser Built in PyQT5. I am tired of seeing all these anti detection browsers like FraudFox selling for 100$ on the Darkweb and people getting 
scammed because they are desperate for money and feel the need to pursue crime. Thats their Perogative... Dont take advantage of them... Try and teach them
Legit ways to get money, Not rip them off, Because if you do that you encourage them to start scamming others etc. Crime is wrong, and should never be done. 
But we also should all work together.. Not hurt each other. 

Simple Python Script, 

Compile with Pyinstaller ive also included the compiled EXE file.

This is a Python Based, Browser built with PyQT5.
